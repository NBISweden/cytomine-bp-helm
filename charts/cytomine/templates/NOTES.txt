Cytomine is being deployed at {{ .Values.global.domainName }}.

Admin credentials are:
    username: admin
{{- if .Values.core.adminPassword }}
    password: {{ .Values.core.adminPassword }}
{{- else }}

A password was automatically generated and injected in the core container,
You can retrieve it with:
    $ kubectl -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} get secret/cytomine-core-config -o jsonpath='{.data.cytomineconfig\.groovy}' | base64 -d | grep -oE 'adminPassword="[0-9a-zA-Z]+"'
{{- end }}

It takes a few minutes for it to fully deploy, so please be patient. This
usually takes about 5 minutes, and if the site isn't reachable in 10 minutes,
something has likely gone wrong.
